This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Deployed on https://rasyadiabdoellah.github.io/crud-client/ and consumes an [Express.js API using Sequelize](https://github.com/RasyadiAbdoellah/sequelize-api).

## Running Locally
Ensure you've got the sequelize API successfully running ( found [here](https://github.com/RasyadiAbdoellah/sequelize-api) ). Next, clone this repo and `npm install` all dependencies. Finally ensure the API url in the `.env` file is pointing to the local server. Type in `npm start`, hit enter, and it should load up the app at `localhost:3000`.
